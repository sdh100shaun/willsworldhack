A last minute lame attempt to stop me feeling guilty for not doing something for WillsworldHack

This is a very poor hack together - I was going to create a plays sentiment analysis tool but work commitments meant I was unable.
In twent or thirty mintues thought with a few apis and quick hack, I produced a class which gave a teleprompter sentiment analysis line by line

I was going to wrap the original project as a sinatra app, but ended up just dropping a hack class in there and not using the sinatra
app. 

to run just make sure plays.rb and plays.json exists in same folder then 

ruby plays.rb "Richard III" for instance
